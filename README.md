# React Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React. This project demonstrates the use of React components, state management, and event handling to create a fully functional game.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Players take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid.
- **Dynamic player names**: Players can edit their names during the game.
- **Game log**: A log of all moves made during the game.
- **Win detection**: Automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart game**: Reset the game board and start a new match.


### Key Components

- **`App.jsx`**: The main component that manages the game state and renders the game board, players, and log.
- **`Player.jsx`**: Handles player name editing and highlights the active player.
- **`GameBoard.jsx`**: Renders the 3x3 grid and handles square selection.
- **`Log.jsx`**: Displays a log of all moves made during the game.
